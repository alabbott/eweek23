Included with this question is an unknown file. 

Buried within the file, under multiple layers, is a string flag that will need to be MD5 hashed to submit as your answer.

It may be required to convert the file type to another, or to decode the contents of a file to make it to the next layer.

The individual layers may include standard picture file formats, archive files, and/or simple text files. 

You can use any tools at your disposal to identify and peel away each layer

The final string will be very obvious.
