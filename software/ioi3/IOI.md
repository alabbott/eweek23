Updated! Friday Feb 24
Intelligent Alien Beings, Intelligent Otherwordly Individuals (or Insects), have sent us a message! 
Actually several. However, we have only decoded 6 of them.

51 0 8 0 0 2 -> 110
104 121 0 0 0 0 -> 121
105 110 0 1 0 0 -> 111
106 12402 1 0 0 0 -> 117
107 75 0 107 0 0 -> 32
108 108 3 0 0 1  -> 111
251 14 47 0 0 0 -> 33

We identified a typo with the line starting with 251 and have fixed it in the file and on this page.

HINT: the left most column has bounds and should be sorted! There are 4 possible encryption methods based on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Now decode some more messages found in IOI.txt

Now add all the integer values and hash it for the correct answer. 
You can see if you get it right by the message being clear integer representation of text!
